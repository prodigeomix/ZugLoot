# ZugLoot — Specification (v0.1 skeleton)

Loot addon for Turtle WoW (1.12, Interface 11200) for **both master looters and raiders**.
Inspiration: **RollFor** (master-looter automation, SR integration, version broadcast,
tie handling, raid-roll) and **LootBlare** (big obvious raider frame, SR/MS/OS/TMOG
buttons with roll caps, raid-warning triggered rolls).

## 1. Goals / non-goals

Goals:

- One addon, two faces: a **master-looter console** (RollFor-like) and a **raider
  loot window** (LootBlare-like, master-loot rolls only by default).
- **SR sheets**: import, secure distribution, SR+ math, fancy in-game sheet view,
  one-win-per-item enforcement, drop log.
- **Auto-roll + auto-resolve**: raiders can auto-roll SR items; if the whole raid
  runs ZugLoot the ML can auto-resolve SR drops without waiting on chat rolls.
- **Visibility**: raid-wide version grid (squares), drop log, simulation mode.
- **Testability**: pure loot logic (parse / resolve) runs both in-game and under
  stock `lua` outside the client (`tests/`).

Non-goals (skeleton): DKP/EPGP, full boss loot database for every raid, LibStub
dependencies, minimap button art. These are extension points, not blockers.

## 2. Roles & security

| Role | How detected (1.12 APIs) | Powers |
|------|--------------------------|--------|
| Loot runner (anyone) | whoever opens the corpse — solo, any loot method, ML or not | Collect loot, start/finish/cancel rolls, award loot |
| Master Looter (ML) | `GetLootMethod()` returns `"master"` + `GetLootMaster()` == player | As loot runner, plus group-chat announces + `ROLL_REQ` to rollers |
| Raid leader / assistant | `IsRaidLeader()` / `IsRaidOfficer()` (fallback: party leader) | Import + broadcast sheet (same as ML) |
| Raider | everyone else | View sheet, roll, auto-roll, sim |

Rules:

1. **Only ML or raid leader/assistant may broadcast a sheet.** This is enforced
   *twice*:
   - sender side: `SRSecurity.CanBroadcast()` gates sending; `ApplySheet` only
     broadcasts when it is true;
   - receiver side: `Comm.OnSheetReceived` verifies the sender `IsML(sender) or
     IsRaidLeaderOrAssistant(sender)` against the *current* roster and drops +
     warns on violation.
1b. **Anyone may load a sheet locally** (paste or `Load from File`, solo or
grouped) for their own view/sim — importing never pushes anything.
Broadcasting stays ML/leader-only (`CanBroadcast()`); synced sheets are
trusted from ML/leader only (`CanAcceptFrom()`). No broadcast happens solo
(`Comm.Channel()` is nil there; `VER_REQ`/`AWARD` also skip).
2. Sheet broadcasts carry `raidID` (= leader name + import timestamp), `version`,
   and a META envelope (raid name + revision stamp). Same-raid updates keep
   the raidID and apply by revision (`importedAt`: raidres export time, else
   import time) — older-or-equal revisions are stale and refused on ALL paths
   (paste, file, sync), BEFORE archiving, so an old export can never roll a
   newer update back. Different raidIDs always apply.
3. Raiders get a **read-only** copy. There is no addon-message path for a raider to
   push sheet edits.
4. Comm prefix: `ZugLoot` (chat addon channel `CHAT_MSG_ADDON`). Message types:
   `SHEET:<ver>:<raidID>:<payload>`, `ROLL_REQ:<sessionID>:<itemLink>:<mode>`,
   `ROLL_ANS:<sessionID>:<name>:<rollType>`, `VER_REQ`, `VER_ANS:<version>`,
   `AWARD:<itemID>:<winner>`, `LOG:<entry>`.

## 3. SR sheet model

```lua
Sheet = {
  meta    = { raidID = "Leader-epoch", raidName = "Molten Core"|nil, importedAt = 0, importedBy = "Name", source = "paste|file" },
  items   = { [itemID] = { quality = 4, rollers = { { name="X", rolls=2, sr_plus=30 }, ... } } },
  hardres = { [itemID] = { quality = 5 } },
  won     = { [itemID] = { ["PlayerName"] = true } },  -- one copy per player per raid
}
```

- `rolls` = how many times the player SR'd that item (duplicate reservations count,
  e.g. `x2`). Displayed as `Name x2`.
- `sr_plus` = highest SR+ bonus across that player's duplicate reservations for the
  item (RollFor parity: keep `max`, never sum). `nil/0` = no bonus.
- `won` is runtime-only (per raid, cleared on new sheet / `/zl reset`). It is what
  powers "won items are visible but marked; that raider can't win another copy".
- `raidName` = instance name from the raidres export (`metadata.instances[1]`,
  else `metadata.instance`); nil for hand-written line sheets. Shown in the
  window header next to the ID.
- `importedAt` = import timestamp = the raid's start time for display and
  raid-list ordering (see Raids tab).

### 3.1 Supported import formats

1. **raidres.top / raidres.fly.dev / softres.it export** (paste path): base64-encoded
   JSON with any of `reservations[]` (new: `character.name`, `raidItemId`,
   `srPlus` as number|string|`{value,isValid}`), `softreserves[]`
   (`name/role/items[{id,quality,sr_plus}]`), `hardreserves[]`. `sr_plus` also
   accepts `rollBonus`/`roll_bonus` (softres.it). Numeric strings coerced.
   `isValid=false` still counts (raidres defaults it to false when validation is
   off) — value is what matters.
2. **Static file** (`CustomData/ZugLoot_SR.txt`, via Load from File): accepts
   *either* a raw raidres export blob pasted into the file (base64, exactly
   what raidres.top gives you), the CSV export below, *or* the static line
   format. Paste-import accepts all three as well; format is auto-detected
   (export first, CSV second, lines third). Lines above the payload
   (tool headers, "copy below this line" notes) are dropped for the
   export and CSV formats.
3. **Static line format** (hand-written sheets, either path):
   `#` comments, blank lines ignored.
   ```
   # Player; itemID[:count][: +srplus], ...
   Blackfang; 17063:2+20, 19137:1
   Carbon; 18646:1+60
   HARDRES; 17782, 18564
   ```
   Grammar per entry: `itemID` (required number), `:count` (default 1),
   `+srplus` (default 0). `HARDRES;` line lists hard-reserved item IDs.
4. **CSV export** (either path): header-matched, so column order and extra
   columns (`Item`, `Boss`, `Comment`, `Date`) don't matter. Minimum
   columns: `ID` (+`Attendee`); minimum per row: numeric ID + non-empty
   attendee (other rows skipped). `Class` feeds the sheet class store
   (unknown still imports, just uncolored); `Specialization` is optional
   (missing = class-default role); `SR+` defaults to 0. Header aliases:
   `ID`/`ItemID`, `Attendee`/`Player`/`Name`/`Character`/`Raider`,
   `Specialization`/`Spec`, `SR+`/`SRPlus`. Lines above the header
   (preamble) are dropped.
   ```
   ID,Item,Boss,Attendee,Class,Specialization,SR+
   18814,"Choker of the Fire Lord",Ragnaros,Pysanka,Paladin,Protection,70
   ```
   STRICT, all-or-nothing: every data row must carry a numeric item ID +
   non-empty attendee. ONE bad row blocks the WHOLE import with its line
   number (e.g. `CSV line 4: missing numeric item ID (got 'Choker ...'
   for attendee 'Pysanka')`) — never half-imports, never a silent
   0-item sheet. Header with zero data rows below it is likewise a loud
   error. Blank lines / `#` comments are ignored, not rows.
5. Anything else → import error naming the first bad line (never half-imports).
6. **Empty-content sheets never move.** A sheet with 0 items and no hard
   reserves is refused at every boundary, live data kept: `ApplySheet`
   (import) refuses before stamping/archiving, `BroadcastSheet` refuses
   before sending, `ApplyReceivedSheet` ignores an empty wire, and
   `AnySheet` treats an empty holder as sheetless (no sync answer).

### 3.2 Roll types (normative): each kind judged by itself

- Ranges (LootBlare parity): SR 1–100, MS 1–100, OS 1–99, TMOG 1–98.
  A roll only counts inside its own range — anything above the TYPE cap is
  an over-roll (flagged, never wins). `effective = base + sr_plus`, where
  the SR bonus applies to SR rolls by sheet rollers ONLY (MS/OS/TMOG never
  take sr_plus).
- Each kind crowns its own winner (`perType`: best SR, best MS, best OS,
  best TMOG) from the RANGE the player chose — 1-100 is SR only with the
  reserve on the item, otherwise MS; 1-99 OS; 1-98 TMOG. Ties re-roll
  WITHIN the kind.
- Overall winner by priority SR > MS > OS: the best SR beats any MS/OS
  roll (TMOG 15 vs SR 58 → SR wins outright). TMOG never takes an overall
  winner slot — it crowns its own kind winner, directly awardable.
- Miss-rolls = SR-range rolls from players WITHOUT the reserve (fake SR
  claims): recorded but ignored. MS/OS rolls are valid kind contests from
  anyone (the sheet only holds SR rollers); TMOG never misses.
- Eligible = not already in `won[itemID]` — for the SR contest ONLY
  (one-win-per-item; excluded SR rolls stay visible with `[already won]`,
  never silently dropped). MS/OS/TMOG stay contestable after a win (e.g.
  rolling transmog after winning mainspec).
- Multi-SR allowance: a player who SR'd the item N times (`rolls`, e.g.
  `x2`) may roll up to N times in one session; their best roll stands.
  Extra rolls are extra chances, never extra winners: a player's own
  rolls never tie against each other, and anything past the allowance is
  ignored. Non-holders roll once.
- Off-sheet rolls (no holders on the item): same single path - kind
  priority SR > MS > OS, with an empty SR contest. An MS 33 beats an
  OS 76 even with nobody holding SR; OS wins only with no MS contest.
- Two-copies drops (`2x<link>`): winner + runner-up (same kind first, then
  other kinds in priority order).
- TMOG is directly awardable: the award window offers `Award <name> (TMOG)`
  for the kind winner next to the outright winner rows. The ML awards the
  SR, MS, OS or TMOG winner; anything after the award (e.g. a trade) is
  outside the addon. Chat follows the raid-roll style (Pysanka parity):
  one `Name: roll (TYPE)` line per roller (already-won tagged inline),
  then `Name wins Item.` on award. Player names in chat are clickable
  class-colored links (`|Hplayer:` wrapped in the class color): click
  opens the whisper menu, color reads class — same as Blizzard's own
  chat name rendering (unknown class links white).
- Raid-roll (loot `Raid roll` button — RollFor +
  Pysanka parity): the raid is announced numbered (`[1]:Name, ...`,
  chunked), the ML rolls 1-N with `/roll`, the number IS the winner
  (frozen roster, so leavers/joiners mid-roll change nothing; only the
  ML's 1-N roll counts, first number only). The item goes straight out
  on the number — no award window. Finish/award reuse the
  normal path, including the award line.
- Sand (loot `Sand` button, Hourglass Sand item 19183 only): the
  lowest-ledger raider takes the row via the master-loot handoff, no
  roll, no award window. Ledger `Z.DB.sand` (`{ [name] = count }`)
  tracks running totals per raider so sand evens out over the raid;
  one corpse slot = one handoff of the whole stack. Never touches the
  SR sheet (no SR, no won mark, no roll history) — DropLog records it
  as `sand`. `/zl sand` prints the ledger, `/zl sand reset` clears it
  (solo always; in group ML/leader only).
- One-win-per-item: after award, `won[itemID][winner]=true`. Sheet view renders
  `WON: Name`; the resolver excludes them from later SR contests for that itemID.
  Excluded rollers stay visible everywhere: their rolls are kept in a separate
  `excluded` list (never silently dropped), shown with an `[already won]` tag in
  the raid result line, the live raider roll list (greyed), sim output, and the
  Sheet tab history lines (`Resolver.ToHistoryEntry` carries them into
  `sheet.rolls`).

### 3.3 Unreserved drops (not on the sheet)

— When a finished roll (live or sim) had rolls for an itemID absent
  from `sheet.items`, a stub `{ quality, rollers = {}, unsr = true }` is added
  via `SRData.EnsureUnreserved` — never touching existing entries, so real SR
  data can't be clobbered. Empty sessions (no rolls) add nothing.
- **Sheet log floor (rare 3+ only)**: roll history, unreserved stubs,
  and won marks only ever cover rare (blue) and above — anything below
  never enters the sheet (`SRData.SHEET_QUALITY_MIN = 3`, enforced via
  `SRData.LoggableQuality` at every roll-session write: `AnnounceResult`
  history + stubs, `Award` won marks, `AWARD` receive won marks).
  Unknown quality (cold item cache, no row) proceeds — it can't be
  classified, so nothing is lost. Quality 0 counts as unknown: poor
  items are always free rows and can never roll. Imports are user data
  and are never filtered.
- Cards: unreserved items render at the **bottom** of the Sheet tab
  (`SRData.SortedCardIDs`: SR'd numeric first, stubs last), with a grey
  `[not SR'd]` title badge and a `(not on SR sheet — open roll)` body line.
  `CardSummary` / `SRView.RenderText` tag them `[not SR'd]` too.
- Stubs are local roll artifacts: `SerializeSheet` emits no lines for
  them (empty rollers), so they never pollute broadcasts; roll-log reset
  prunes them (`PruneUnreserved`) and the sheet returns to imported state.

## 4. UI

### 4.1 Main window (`MainWindow.lua`) — both roles, Aegis-SBR-skinned

- `/zl sheet` opens the big tabbed window (900×640 target, clamped to screen
  minus margins, min 480×360, re-clamped + rebuilt on resolution/UI-scale
  change, clamped-to-screen dragging; movable, flat dark palette,
  gold accent strip, tab rail with gold underline on the active tab, per-tab
  scroll bodies with scrollbar + mouse wheel). Tabs: **Sheet** (default) |
  **Raids** | **Members** | **Setup**. `/zl log` prints the drop log to
  chat, `/zl ver` opens Members, `/zl raids` opens Raids. Header row:
  Reset rolls | Get sheet (always visible; solo prints “nobody to ask”) | Import | File —
  Setup holds options only (no duplicate import/clear buttons). (`SRView`/
  `VersionGrid` standalone frames retired into tabs; their modules keep
  pure logic + slash commands. DropLog has no tab: `Show()` prints.)
- Minimap ZL badge (`Minimap.lua`, `Media/ZL-Badge.tga` — one
  prerendered image: feathered black disc + Griffy gold `ZL` + halo,
  ink centered by measured bbox at bake time; no FontStrings, so client
  font/anchor drift can't move the letters): click toggles the main
  window, hover shows version/raid/role, drag repositions (angle
  persisted per character). Classic tracking ring tinted gold on top.
- **Brand**: the `ZUGLOOT` header uses the same bundled Griffy face
  (`Z.Fonts.DISPLAY`, pcall-guarded with template-font fallback), gold
  on the dark header — badge and window read as one identity.
- **Sheet tab**, one card per item in **3 even columns** (row-major flow,
  single shared scroll body — columns scroll together; card styling
  unchanged): SR rollers in **two columns** inside each card, drop count as
  a green `[xN]` badge, **left-click opens the item roll-log window** (loot
  icon + name header, every roll newest-first): SR'd items alphabetical
  by name (client cache, else sheet name, else item:id fallback; numeric
  ids break ties),
  unreserved items (rolled but never SR'd — auto-added at the bottom, see §3.3):
  - icon button (texture via `GetItemInfo(tonumber(id))` numeric-ID trick, cf.
    LootBlare fix #8; quality-color bottom border). **Hover = full GameTooltip
    item details** (`SetHyperlink` when the client knows the item, fallback
    text otherwise). Click inserts the link into an open chat box,
    ctrl-click tries it on (DressUp). All five item icons in the addon
    (sheet cards, log header, raider window, loot rows, loot detail) run
    the ONE shared implementation (`ItemIcon.lua`), so hover/ctrl/shift
    behave identically everywhere.
  - title: quality-colored name + `[HR]` tag + green `[rolled xN]` badge +
    grey `[not SR'd]` badge for unreserved items.
  - SR list: `Name xN (+SR+)` (SR+ in gold), `[WON]` marks for already-won.
  - roll history: every finished roll this raid as its own block
    (`— rolls #k (mode) => winners`), **one line per player**:
    `Carbon 95(+130=225)` with `WINNER:` prefix, `[miss — no SR]` /
    `[already won]` flags where applicable.
  - zebra rows; row hover tooltip summarizes SR/HR + roll state.
- Card data comes from pure `ItemCards.BuildCards(sheet)` (tested); roll
  rolls persist in `sheet.rolls[itemID]` (capped at 25/item), recorded by
  `MasterLootUI.AnnounceResult` for every finished roll.
- Header: brand row carries a prominent green `ACTIVE RAID: <name> | started
  <date>` (grey `no active raid` when no sheet; name "—" for line sheets
  without instance info); sub-line `ID <raidID> | <raid name> | started <date>
  | N items | M rolled`. Setup tab: Import (paste),
  Load from File, auto-roll toggle, clear won marks, **Reset all settings**
  (factory reset with confirmation: sheet, raid history, drop log and all
  options back to defaults; local data only, no permission gate),
  auto loot-method switching (**ML on boss**: as raid leader, flip
  to master loot when selecting a raid boss — worldboss flag or 100k+ HP
  (indoor bosses report elite; raid trash never reaches 100k), raid only; **Boss
  threshold** dropdown (Common 1 .. Epic 4, default Epic) rides along
  with the switch, previous threshold remembered and restored on
  switch-back;
  **Back to group**: flip back to group loot once the boss is fully
  looted — only after OUR auto-switch, never yanks a manual change;
  both off by default), roll-time/log stats.
- **Raids tab**: imported raids with the **latest raid at the top**, ordered
  by raid datetime = the sheet's `meta.importedAt` import timestamp (the
  closest thing to a raid start time the sheet carries; `archivedAt` is only
  a fallback for legacy snapshots). Archive position never affects order, so
  re-archiving an old raid can't shuffle it above newer ones. The live sheet
  is always listed too (synced on load and on every render, so a just-loaded
  raid shows up even though it was never unloaded). Each row is titled with
  the raid name (+ green `[ACTIVE]` on the live one; "—" when unknown) and
  lists `ID <raidID>`, `started <date>`, importer, source, and counts
  (items / players / rolls / won). **Activate** makes a raid the live
  sheet and continues it — won marks + roll history come along, and the
  outgoing sheet is archived first so no progress is lost (`/zl raid <raidID>`
  does the same from chat). History lives in `ZugLootDB.raidArchive` (capped
  at 20, deduped by raidID); every import, incoming broadcast, and activation
  archives the outgoing sheet first (pure `RaidArchive` module, tested).

### 4.2 Loot console (`MasterLootUI.lua`) — RollFor-like, universal

- `/zl` shows console: loot list (current loot window items w/ SR badges + counts).
Rolls start from the loot-window Roll / Raid roll buttons only. Announce via
RAID_WARNING (LootBlare trigger compatibility) + `ROLL_REQ` addon message.
Accept chat `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` rolls (`X rolls Y (1-Z)`) while the roll
window is open, up to the player's SR allowance (one roll, or N rolls
for N reservations of the item); over-rolls flagged, ties
re-roll fresh. Exactly one roll at a time — closing its window ends it.
Raider clients pop their roll window off the ML/RL's RAID_WARNING roll
call ONLY (`MatchRollCall`: `Roll for X: /roll ...` dice line or full
item link — Pysanka parity). Drop lists, winners, countdowns, stop
lines, raid-roll numbering, bare names and non-ML senders never trigger.
- **Loot window** (`LootWindow.lua`, raider-window style (220px dark
  frame, icon + quality-colored name rows, roll detail with header icon
  + two-column roll list) — always ours, never Blizzard's): on
  `LOOT_OPENED`, whoever opened the corpse (solo, any loot method, ML or
  not), EVERY corpse slot gets a row (RollFor parity): coin first, then
  roll-worthy items (quality ≥ the party's `GetLootThreshold`, 1 common
  .. 4 epic), then below-threshold leftovers (grey quality 0 always) as
  one-click free rows that loot straight to the player in any loot method. Blizzard's `LootFrame`
  is DETACHED session-wide (RollFor `main.lua:on_player_login` parity:
  `UnregisterAllEvents` + `OnHide` stripped at `ADDON_LOADED`, re-armed
  per `LOOT_OPENED`) — one-shot hiding is NOT enough, FrameXML re-shows
  the frame on every loot — so our rows are the loot window in every
  looting situation. NOTHING falls back to Blizzard: coin/free rows loot
  their slot on click; grouped, roll rows open the detail, while SOLO every
  row loots on click (Blizzard solo behavior — nobody to roll against, so
  no detail opens). At/above the PARTY threshold (`GetLootThreshold`,
  1 common→4 epic): master-loot hands the item out via the roll window,
  group loot enters a real group roll — listed with a `ROLL` badge, click
  never loots (Blizzard's Need/Greed frames own them, mirrored in our dice
  frame which votes via `RollOnLoot`, never chat `/roll`); below it the
  item loots straight to the player (grey/white never roll). Slot quality comes from the slot's own
  `GetLootSlotInfo`, never the maybe-cold item cache. Click-to-loot is
  CONFIRM-driven, never optimistic: the click issues the corpse call and
  dims the row; the row drops only when `LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED` confirms the
  slot left the corpse — a failed call (locked slot, full bags, out of
  range) leaves the row up for retry, and a pcall-level blowup surfaces
  in chat instead of dimming the row into a "done but not looted" ghost.
  BoP takes confirm via `LOOT_BIND_CONFIRM` → `ConfirmLootSlot`.
  Kill-switch: two consecutive solo clicks that issue clean but never
  confirm (no `LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED`, no error) restore Blizzard's frame and
  stand our rows down to display-only (`passthrough`) — a dead `LootSlot`
  path must yield to the stock UI, never strand dimmed rows. Confirms,
  errors, and failed-but-present rescans all disarm the watch; awards
  never arm it; the watch is corpse-scoped (a new corpse starts clean).
  Corpse-open flag (`MasterLootUI.lootOpen`, true between `LOOT_OPENED`
  and `LOOT_CLOSED`): with no corpse open there is no call that can land.
  Clicks and live awards both check it FIRST — before range, before slot
  verify — and block with `"not looting"` / `"Not awarding <name>: no
  loot open"`, list + row untouched; re-looting resumes the window. This
  is what stops the walk-away wipe: the old code read an empty (closed)
  corpse as `"gone"` and rescanned every row away. Rescans with no open
  corpse likewise keep all rows (an unreadable corpse proves nothing
  left). Sim/non-row awards bypass the gate (no corpse).
  Range gate: "moved away" is read off `CheckInteractDistance("target",
  1)` against the corpse pinned at scan — by GUID when the client offers
  one, else by target name. Same corpse + out of range = moved: the click
  is blocked BEFORE the corpse call (`"not looting"` + chat log telling
  the player to loot the corpse again), the list is untouched — nothing
  dims, nothing clears. A different GUID is never a range block (identity
  belongs to the corpse key).
  Corpse identity: `UnitExists("target")` returns `(exists, guid)` on this
  client (Nampower/SuperWoW extension — DoiteAuras/Luna/Aegis_SBR rely on
  the same second return; GUIDs double as unit tokens). The corpse key is
  `guid:<guid>` when available, else `fp:<name>|<sorted ids>[|+coin]`.
  Walk-away-and-back reuses the window: `LOOT_CLOSED` with leftovers
  keeps the rows, and re-looting the SAME corpse (key match) reconciles
  instead of wiping — an open roll keeps collecting while its window is
  open. A different corpse rebuilds as before.
  Row corpse cache (`MasterLootUI.corpseCache`, never persisted — empty
  at load, no SavedVariables): each not-fully-looted corpse owns its rows
  (+ open detail, click arms) under its key. Restore takes (no stale
  copies); fully-looted corpses are forgotten; abandoned ones evict
  oldest-first past a cap of 5. Rolls are never parked: an open window
  kept collecting, a closed one ended its roll.
  Each roll-row item is
  announced + logged (`loot`/`seen`), awarding loots the corpse slot
  through Blizzard's APIs (master loot hands to another winner by
  CANDIDATE INDEX via `GetMasterLootCandidate` — RollFor parity, never by
  name; a non-candidate award is refused with the row kept — plain
  `LootSlot` otherwise), and the overview Close button reconciles with
  the corpse (empty list closes out). `LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED` while open
  re-scans by identity multiset (slot numbers shift after each loot, so
  duplicate itemIDs track correctly); the last award closes the corpse
  out via `CloseLoot`.
  The **loot window
  lists every drop as a numbered row: row number, item icon, quality-colored
  item name, and the SR/HR badge on the right** (resolution chain per row —
  same source the sheet list uses: `GetItemInfo(row link)`, then
  `GetItemInfo(itemID)`, then the slot texture/name captured at scan time,
  then `[Name]` parsed out of the link; rows never show bare `item:<id>` while
  the client cache knows the item; the row icon and the row-detail header
  icon run the same shared handlers as every other icon (hover details,
  ctrl dress-up, click/shift link — a plain row click still opens the
  detail / loots the slot). The raider roll window resolves its icon + name
  through the same link-first chain (`RaiderLootUI.SetItemInfo` →
  `LootWindow.ResolveItemInfo`), so it matches the loot list instead of
  degrading to a `?` icon and raw-link text when the bare-ID cache key
  misses.
- **Row detail = the roll window** (RollFor preview → rolling → winners in
  one window): clicking a row opens the detail with
  Award (direct award on a single holder) / Roll / Close. Choosing **Roll
  keeps the window open** — it flips to the rolling view listing every
  valid roll with its kind (`SR: Aaa 90 (=100)`), SR > MS > OS > TMOG
  best-first, with Finish / Cancel / Close, plus the **countdown bar +
  seconds** (raider-window parity: green→orange→red, pulsing under 5s) —
  seeded at the full window the moment the roll starts, ticking every
  second, clearing on finish/cancel/close. There is exactly ONE roll at a
  time (`MasterLootUI.roll`, set only while its window is open): any roll
  — real `/roll` or test fake — lands on it or nowhere. Closing the window
  ends the roll early (intake dead, clock disarmed); a closed roll never
  finishes late and never awards. **Finish resolves the roll and the same
  window becomes the award window**: TWO award buttons -- `Award <winner>`
  (kind winner by priority) and `Award TMOG (<name>)` whenever the TMOG
  kind was contested — `...` for anyone else (candidates: any raider, for
  when something is wrong with the rolls), Close. **Continue rolling**
  reopens intake on the finished round with the landed rolls kept
  (unlike **Roll again**, which starts fresh); newcomers roll in,
  re-rollers are allowance-capped. Awarding ends any open
  roll first, then hands out the item and closes the window; the row
  leaves the list (done = gone). Ties stay open for a fresh re-roll round.
  Cancel ends the roll and drops the window back to pick (re-roll /
  choose / close). (`HR` red for hard reserves, `SR` / `SR:n` orange for
  soft reserves). Nothing auto-starts — clicking a row opens the **row
  detail**: direct **Award** when exactly one SR/HR holder exists (no
  rolling needed), **Roll** + **Raid roll** as their own buttons (never
  inside `...`; raid roll numbers the raid and the ML's number wins the
  item straight out, no award window), **...** for a real dropdown
  (RollFor parity: blue-hover rows — Award per reserver, plus one row
  per raid class like `Warrior (4) >`): hovering (or clicking) a class row pops a side submenu
  with that class's players, so the whole raid is one hover away instead
  of a flat 40-name list. Every submenu name awards directly, even before
  a roll, and nobody already listed above repeats inside a group.
  The award window keeps **Continue rolling**, **Roll again**,
  **Raid roll** and **Ignore** as bar buttons
  next to the winners. **Ignore** (on every phase: pick, rolling,
  award) marks the row ignored — it STAYS listed (`[ignored]`) with no
  award, no won mark, no corpse take and no roll history; the item stays
  on the corpse for manual handling, the audit log records it as
  ignored. Sim rows advance the queue — and a mistakenly-ignored sim
  row stays fully operable: it survives other items' awards on the
  window (award-time re-sync carries ignored rows over, flag intact —
  live parity), and rolling it re-queues fresh standard fakes from
  the sheet (the ignored mark clears, like live), so Roll, Raid roll,
  Award and ... all work on it again. Only a row that actually left
  the list still refuses (`not in the test queue`). When no rows remain, or only
  ignored rows do, looting is finished: the detail closes, the loot
  window can close, and a raid-boss auto-switch flips back to group
  loot when it should.
  **Close** to dismiss and keep working the overview. `/zl cr`
  returns the item to open.
- **Award menu** (RollFor finish-popup style): on SR-roll completion nothing is
  auto-awarded — the ML gets winners (ranked, roll-typed) + SR/MS/OS/TMOG
  loser groups + a **class-sorted candidate roster** (sheet + rollers + raid
  roster, winners starred like RollFor's candidate grid), and picks who gets
  the item: the SR winner, a main-spec / offspec / TMOG roller, or any raider
  from the roster. Every name renders in its **class color** (see §4.8).
  In-client this is the menu frame; headless it prints and
  the ML answers `/zl award <name>`. The pick fires the confirmation popup
  (`Award <link> to <name>?`) → `GiveMasterLoot` + `AWARD` broadcast + `won`
  marking + DropLog entry.
- **TMOG kind award**: whenever the TMOG kind was contested, the menu offers
  `Award TMOG (<name>)` next to the outright winner — the ML awards the SR,
  MS, OS or TMOG winner directly. No trade handling: the award is final.

### 4.3 Raider loot window (`RaiderLootUI.lua`) — LootBlare-like

- Appears for master-loot rolls ONLY (default): (a) the ML's `ROLL_REQ`
  addon message, or (b) the ML/RL's RAID_WARNING roll call
  (`MatchRollCall`: `Roll for X: /roll ...` dice line or full item link
  — Pysanka parity). Group-loot rolls, solo, and anyone else's chat
  never pop it — Blizzard's own Need/Greed frames own the group-loot
  vote (mirroring them would double-vote or forfeit), and solo has
  nobody to roll against. Opt-out: Setup toggle `Roll window: ML/ALL`
  (`Z.DB.raiderFrame`, default `ml`) — `ALL` restores the legacy
  group-loot mirror (`START_LOOT_ROLL` → dice vote via `RollOnLoot`)
  + local preview. Gate: `RaiderLootUI.MayShow` (policy) +
  `AllowMasterFrame` (live grouped-master-loot check); every open
  funnels through `ShowItem`, which refuses (returns false) when shut.
  Verifiable: `tests/test_raider_frame.lua` pins mode/allow/matrix +
  trigger paths per grouping and loot method.
- Contents (LootBlare layout, 220×250): green countdown **status bar floating
  above the frame** with seconds text (green→orange→red, pulsing under 5s),
  big 40px item icon (shared handlers: hover = item tooltip, click =
  chat-link, ctrl-click = dress-up — identical on all five icons) +
  quality-colored truncated name, quality-colored frame border, big countdown
  digits, **two-column roll list** — class-colored names left, `roll (min-max)`
  in roll-type color right, grouped **SR > MS > OS > TMOG**, best-first, max 8
  rows — four **dice buttons** (SR/MS/OS/TM) with colored borders, hover glow
  and tooltips, plus a top-screen huge-text **winner banner** (5s fade, winner
  in class color). Roll-list class resolution is roster-first with the SR
  sheet as fallback (see §4.8).
- Rolls up to the SR allowance (one roll, or N for N reservations of
the item); extra rolls ignored with notice. Auto-close timer configurable
  (`/zl time N`, `/zl autoclose on|off`).
- Draggable; `/zl show|hide`.

### 4.8 Class-colored names (`ClassColors.lua`)

- Every character name the addon renders — Sheet tab rollers/history,
  loot-window roll lists/award rows/`...` choices, award
  menu + confirm, winner banner, version grid + `/zl verlist`, drop-log
  lines — shows in its Blizzard **class color** (Paladin pink etc.).
- Source order: the **live party/raid member list first** (raid roster,
  then party units + self), **fallback to the class stored on the SR sheet**
  at import (`sheet.players`, from raidres `character.class` / legacy `role`).
  Unknown names stay plain white; solo/offline clients still get sheet colors.
- Roles carry class+spec (`PaladinHoly`): the **class prefix colors the name**,
  the spec is ignored. Case/abbreviation/file-name tolerant
  (`paladin`, `PALADIN`, `War` all resolve).
- Display-only: stored data (sheet, history, `PLAYERS` broadcast line,
  archive snapshots) keeps raw class strings, and **addon chat carries no
  color codes** — result/kind lines print plain names. Pure + headless-safe
  (nil-guarded roster APIs) with `tests/test_classcolors.lua` coverage.

### 4.4 Members grid (`VersionGrid.lua`, Members tab)

- `/zl ver` requests versions (`VER_REQ` → all clients answer `VER_ANS`).
- Sheet fetch (Members tab “Request SR sheet” button, `/zl sheetreq`):
  `SHEET_REQ` → the **master looter answers at once** with their sheet;
  the **raid leader/assistant answers after a 5s delay, only when no ML
  sheet exists** (no master loot, ML absent/unknown, or ML sheetless) —
  an arriving SHEET cancels the pending leader reply, so the group never
  gets two competing sheets. Raiders never answer. Receivers trust ONLY
  ML/leader sheets (`CanAcceptFrom` — a raider's sheet is refused even if
  one arrives). Solo: nobody to ask.
- Targeted sync (`/zl sync <name>`, bare name or color-coded `[Name]`
  player link): `SHEET_REQ:<name>` → ONLY the named player answers,
  directly (anyone holding a sheet may answer — imports are open to
  all). Trust stays on RECEIVE: a non-ML/leader answer still lands and
  is refused by `CanAcceptFrom` with the usual message.
- Wire encoding (`Comm.EncodeSheetPayload` / `SRImport.DecodeSheetPayload`):
  base64-wrapped when an encoder exists, else `%`-escaped raw (`%` →
  `%P`, `|` → `%B`). NEVER a bare `|`: ChatThrottleLib (bundled with other
  addons on this client) rejects bare pipes in chat/addon traffic with
  “Invalid escape code in chat message”. Decode order: `%B` → `|` first,
  `%P` → `%` last.
- Raid identity envelope: `SerializeSheet` leads with a
  `META;raidID=…,name=…,by=…,at=…,src=…` line (commas escaped `%C`), so a
  synced sheet shows the raid name in the header/archive instead of "—".
  `ParseLineFormat` skips META; `ExtractMeta` strips + parses it on
  receive; legacy senders without META still get message-raidID + trusted
  sender stamped. `DeserializeSheet` applies META only where non-empty.
- Drop progress rides along: `SerializeSheet` appends `UNSR;<id>:q<quality>…`
  (unreserved stubs — rolled but never SR'd, which carry no rollers so
  the item loop emits nothing for them), `WON;<id>=<name>…` (won marks)
  + one `ROLLH;<itemID>,<t>,<mode>,<winners>,<entries…>` line per recorded
  roll session, so every SHEET sync carries what was rolled and who won
  — raiders see the same sheet as the ML. Names escape `%X`-style
  (`%`→`%P`, `|`→`%B`, `,`→`%C`, `;`→`%S`, `:`→`%N`, `+`→`%A`).
  `ParseLineFormat` parses all three heads without eating hand-written
  player lines: WON needs `=` in the tail, UNSR needs the `:q` marker
  (colon-count stays player syntax), ROLLH strict-decodes and falls back
  to the player path on failure (genuine modes always contain a letter,
  so bare-id reservations can never decode). Malformed WON/UNSR parts
  skip quietly, never nuking a sync.
- Live session deltas: at finish time the ML's client records the session
  (`RecordRolls`) and immediately sends
  `ROLLLOG:<ver>:<raidID>:<itemID>:<tail>` (same tail encoding as ROLLH,
  chunked as `ROLLLOG_C:…:<seq>:<total>:<chunk>` past 160 bytes) — the
  raid learns what was rolled the moment it is recorded. Won marks
  follow at award time via the existing `AWARD:<itemID>:<winner>`.
  Send-side: `CanBroadcast` (ML/leader) + non-solo channel; receive-side:
  `CanAcceptFrom` trust + live sheet of the SAME raidID (anything else
  ignored — the next full SHEET recovers), appended via `RecordRolls`
  with views refreshed underneath.
- Grid of **rectangles**: group first, then SR-sheet players not in the
  group. Full name in class color (outlined). Colors (muted):
  green = in group + on the sheet, red = in group + no SR,
  amber = outdated addon (beats sheet green), grey = sheet, not in group.
  Tooltip: name, version, what the color means. Self seeds on request
  (solo sends nothing, so the grid must not claim we lack the addon).
- Text list fallback via `/zl verlist`. Grid doubles as auto-resolve readiness:
  all-green ⇒ ML's `Auto-resolve` button enabled.

### 4.5 Auto-roll (`AutoRoll.lua`)

- Per-character opt-in: `/zl auto on|off` (default off). Stored in `ZugLootCharDB`.
- When a `ROLL_REQ`/warning arrives for an item the player SR'd (and hasn't won),
  auto `/roll`s with SR cap after 1s jitter (avoids thundering herd).
- **Auto-resolve**: if every eligible SR roller is version-grid green with auto-roll
  on, the ML is told all rollers are auto (the rolls themselves still
  arrive as normal `/roll` chat).

### 4.6 Simulation (`Sim.lua`)

In-game, no raid needed. **Requires the loaded sheet** — without one the
commands refuse with a pointer to `/zl import`. Sim exists ONLY
to test master looting: it opens the SAME roll window through the SAME
`MasterLootUI` roll, with fake rolls landing instantly (no timers, no
scheduling) alongside any real `/roll`s. One roll at a time; the open
window owns everything; closing it ends the roll — exactly like live.

- `/zl sim <itemLink> [N]` — one-shot: queues the item, opens its roll,
  lands the fakes at once. On-sheet item: its SR rollers roll (plus N
  optional `RollerN` fillers). Off-sheet item: every player on the sheet
  rolls (plus N fillers).
- `/zl simboss <boss> [raid]` — rolls the boss's OWN drops from the LIVE
  Atlas-CFM loot tables (`AtlasLoot.lua` reads `AtlasCFM.InstanceData` —
  the same tables + `dropRate` percents the Atlas browser shows — straight
  from the game; nothing is copied into this project, and Atlas-CFM is an
  OPTIONAL dependency: without it loaded the command refuses with a
  pointer). Each listed drop gets an INDEPENDENT chance roll per run
  (entry `dropRate` → boss `defaults` → 0.5% floor, clamped 0–100; a 13%
  tier piece drops ~1 run in 8, a 100% quest item always) — so consecutive
  runs vary by design. Server-filtered entries (Turtle vs Vanilla+ item
  variants) are skipped via `AtlasCFM.Server.IsVisible`; the pool is epic+
  (`GetItemInfo` quality ≥ 4, unknown/uncached quality kept, so Turtle
  customs survive a cold cache). Multi-word names work (`/zl simboss
  Ragnaros`); a trailing raid name disambiguates (`/zl simboss Ragnaros
  Molten Core`). An all-miss run rolls nothing and says so — try again.
  The drops land in the
  **same loot window** (title `Simulated loot: <boss>`, source `sim`) and
  stops: the ML — you — initiates every roll from the list (Roll button),
  in any order. After each finish the award window decides the winner;
  the awarded item leaves the list and stays gone, won marks apply
  immediately, so the one-win rule chains across drops exactly like a
  real raid night. `/zl simstop` is a full stop: ends any open roll,
  drops the queue, and closes the windows — a fresh `/zl sim` can start
  immediately.
- `/zl simraid <raid>` — a CONDENSED full raid: ONE boss at a time, each
  through the SAME simboss starter (`Sim.QueueBossRun` — no parallel
  implementation). A trash row rolls BEFORE each boss — the mobs cleared
  walking up to it — then the boss. When a boss's queue drains (every
  drop awarded), the next stage queues automatically off the normal
  queue-drain path (`Sim.NextRaidStage`, via `AfterAward`); after the
  last boss the run ends like any sim. Unknown raids get the raid list;
  a raid with no lootable bosses refuses; `/zl simstop` stops the whole
  raid anywhere.
- Nothing auto-awards, ever: the sim awards on the same window too.
  After the ML picks, the confirm popup fires and the queue continues.
- `/zl simtmog <itemLink>` — transmog demo: one roller rolls TMOG instead
  of SR; the award window offers the TMOG kind winner next to the outright
  winner and the ML awards either directly.
- **One chat router, one set of lines.** Sim and live rolls share
  `Comm.Say` — the ONLY difference is the channel: solo → the ZugLoot
  log (local chat frame), party → `PARTY`, raid → `RAID` (`RAID_WARNING`
  for roll-start warnings; warnings have no party channel, so plain
  party text). Every roll line goes through shared builders in
  `MasterLootUI` (`StartLine`, `RollLine` via `AddRoll`, `ResultLine`,
  `AwardLine`, `SandLine`) + shared senders (`AnnounceRoll`,
  `AnnounceVerdict`, `AnnounceAward`, `AnnounceSand`) — a solo sim
  prints byte-for-byte what the raid would see in group chat. Every
  line carries a REAL clickable item link (`ChatItemLink`: row link →
  client cache → synthesized `BuildLink` off the resolved name +
  quality) — never bare white text, never a bare item:id; sim rows
  pre-resolve name/quality (`Sim.syncWindow`) so bare-id sim entries
  link correctly too.
  Verifiable without a raid: `tests/test_chat_routing.lua` pins
  text + channel per grouping and role (live ML-only: party PARTY-only,
  raid RAID/RAID_WARNING-only, solo and non-ML raiders log-only;
  sim always speaks to the group so the raid sees test rolls, identical
  text). Sim sessions stay silent on
  the addon channel (no `ROLL_REQ` broadcast), so other clients'
  windows and auto-rolls never fire.
- Every sim roll is **written back into the sheet**: roll history
  (`sheet.rolls`, mode `SIM`, same shape as live via
  `Resolver.ToHistoryEntry`), won marks, and drop-log entries
  (source `sim`). Visible in the Sheet tab right away. The sheet log
  floor applies (rare 3+ only — see §3.3).
- `Timer.lua` stays for the roll clock and the click-to-loot watchdog
  (`LootWindow.WatchClick`).
- Uses the **same** `Resolver` pure module as real sessions and as `tests/`, so
  sim output matches tested logic. Randomness via `math.random`, seeded by time.

### 4.7 Drop log (`DropLog.lua`)

- Every observed drop (ML loot window / announced item) appended:
  `{ time, itemID, itemLink, source(boss/manual), strategy, winner, price:nil }`.
- `/zl log` prints the log to chat (newest first), `/zl logclear` (ML/RL only).
- Persisted in `ZugLootDB.drops` (cap 500, ring buffer).

`table.getn` shim in `Util` if needed; actually skeleton uses `#`-free counting
via `Util.Count` so it parses on 5.0 and runs on 5.5 tests).

## 7. Testing

- Outside client: `lua tests/run_tests.lua` (repo root = `ZugLoot/`). Covers:
  line-format parse, base64/raidres transform incl. all `srPlus` spellings,
  max-not-sum SR+, winner/tie/miss-roll/one-win-per-item/2x, file-example parse.
- In game: `/zl sim` + `/zl simboss` exercise the same `Resolver`; import a sheet
  via paste and via `Load from File`; check version grid with a second client.
- Lua 5.0 compliance (the 1.12 client runs 5.0; the suite runs 5.5, which
  accepts everything 5.0 rejects): no `#`, no `%` operator (use
  `Util.Mod` / the local `mod` in standalone files like Resolver),
  no `//`, no `goto`, no bitwise ops, no `table.unpack`, no bare
  `string.gmatch` (use the `string.gmatch or string.gfind` idiom).
  Enforced by the `lua50 gate` in `tests/run_tests.lua` — a static scan
  that fails the suite on any hit. Plus polyfill coverage: `Util.lua`
  (2nd in the toc) shims `string.match`/`string.gmatch` off
  `string.find`/`string.gfind` when the client lacks them, and
  `tests/test_util.lua` simulates a strict-5.0 client (natives hidden)
  to prove the shims hold. Background: a `#` in Core.lua once
  killed `/zl` entirely (whole-file parse failure) while the addon still
  showed in the addon list; later a missing `string.match` on a strict
  client broke every `/zl` command the same way.

## 8. Requirements traceability

- SR import + ML/RL-only security → §2, `SRSecurity` + `Comm` guards + `SRImport`.
- SR+ calc → §3.2, `SRData.ExtractSRPlus` + `Resolver.Effective`.
- Fancy sheet view, sorted by item, player ×N + SR+, won-but-blocked → §3, §4.1.
- ML interface (RollFor-like) → §4.2. Raider window (LootBlare-like) → §4.3.
- Auto-roll SR + full-raid auto-resolve + version squares grid → §4.4, §4.5.
- In-game sim (SR resolution, rolling, raid roll, miss-roll, results) + outside
  tests → §4.6, §7.
- Drop log → §4.7. Static file import w/ button → §3.1(2), `FileIO` + `SRImport`.
- Group-loot item display (LootBlare-style) → §4.3(c).
